# An-Interactive-search-Engine

## Motivation :-
Let's imagine we are in the era before 1990 where there was no search Engine. So if you want any information, what would be the ideal place to look for the information? Yes, all the answers that popped in your minds are absolutely correct. We would definitely be engagging in a long tedius work of searching information from documents in a library. Therefore with this aspect,one should accept the fact that invention of search engine is no doubt a remarkable discovery of 20th century. Therefore it should be noted that designing a search engine is a lot of convoluted process which is very challenging and fun. 
With a great passion towards problem solving and challenges , I have implemented the most famous information retrieval algorithms that are the back bone of search engine using pyspark which can be very effective in terms of time complexities on big data processing.
